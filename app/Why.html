    Our app has an inbuilt logic to detect the store from which the app was installed and redirect you to the app page on the detected store. At the moment this works only for Google Play Store and Amaxon App Store. If you downloaded the app from any other source we could not identify it and hence request you to choose the source from the list below so that we can take you to the right store.

    <p>
        In the following cases:
        <ul>
            <li>If you are reviweing the app and have not downloaded it from the main app store</li>
            <li>If you directly downloaded the app using the apk</li>
            <li>If you downloaded the app from a store other than Google Play Store or Amazon app store</li>
        </ul>
